Concept testing. Does a package that lets you tidyverse graph your own regression model matter? Is it already existing in ggplot2?

It totally already exists in ggplot. That is cool though, I'm glad it exists and that I know a bit about how to use it now :)

```{r}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv(here("data/HomesNNY.csv"))
data_train <- data[1:10,]
```

```{r}
mod <- lm(Price_thousands ~ Size_sqft, data = data)
summary(mod)
```


```{r}
library(splines)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Size_sqft, y = Price_thousands)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(data = data_train, method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ bs(x, 2))
```

```{r}
library(glmnet)
```

```{r}
mod2 <- glmnet()
```
